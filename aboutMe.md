Hello,

I'm a passionate 15-year-old programmer who feels right at home in the world of web development. My focus lies in utilizing technologies such as React, TypeScript, and JavaScript to craft innovative and engaging solutions. Despite my young age, I bring a dedication to code and creative problem-solving that propels me to constantly learn and enhance my skills.

With React, I can build robust and scalable user interfaces, while TypeScript supports my development with type safety and clean code. JavaScript is my steadfast companion for implementing dynamic features and interactions on the website.

I look forward to deepening my passion for the programming world and perhaps even participating in exciting projects. If you're interested in collaboration or sharing experiences, I'm here and ready to connect.

Best regards,
Gero
